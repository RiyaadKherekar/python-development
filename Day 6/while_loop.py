# For Loops:
# for item in list_of_items:
#     do something to each item
    
# for number in range(a, b):
#     print(number)

# While Loops:
# while something_is_true:
#     do something repeatedly 
    
# Only when something becoems false, the while loop will stop.

# Example of While Loop using Reeborgs World:
    
number_of_hurdles = 6

while number_of_hurdles > 0:
    jump()
    number_of_hurdles -= 1
    print(number_of_hurdles)
