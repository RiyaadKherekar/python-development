#Allows a user to enter something, like giving a prompt to the user on the console. 
#Example 1
#input("What is your name?")

#Example 2
#In order to print the input to the console, we would need to print the output as follows: 
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?")) 

#Challenge
# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
# e.g.
# https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow
# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.
# Example Input
# Angela
# Example Output
# 6

#This print function will use the len() function to calculate the length of the input string
#print(input("What is your name?"))
print(len("Riyaad"))
#print(len(input("What is your name?")))
